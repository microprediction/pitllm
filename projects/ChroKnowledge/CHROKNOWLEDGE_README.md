# ChroKnowledge - Project Summary

## Overview

ChroKnowledge is a novel sampling-based framework for evaluating and updating Large Language Models' non-parametric chronological knowledge across multiple domains. The project addresses the challenge of assessing and ensuring chronological knowledge in LLMs by introducing both a benchmark dataset (ChroKnowBench) and an evaluation framework that can handle the accumulative and evolving nature of knowledge.

## Key Components

### ChroKnowBench (Benchmark Dataset)
- **Purpose**: Benchmark dataset designed to evaluate chronologically accumulated knowledge
- **Coverage**: Five domains - general, biomedical, legal, commonsense, and mathematics
- **Key Aspects**: Multiple domains, time dependency, temporal state
- **Distinction**: Separates evolving knowledge (e.g., scientific discoveries, amended laws) from constant knowledge (e.g., mathematical truths, commonsense facts)

### ChroKnowledge (Evaluation Framework)
- **Purpose**: Sampling-based framework for evaluating LLMs' non-parametric chronological knowledge
- **Method**: Novel approach to chronological categorization of knowledge
- **Capability**: Can update knowledge without retraining effort

### ChroKnowPrompt (Prompting Method)
- **Purpose**: In-depth prompting to elicit chronological knowledge
- **Method**: Traverses step-by-step through surrounding time spans
- **Effectiveness**: Successfully recalls objects across both open-source and proprietary LLMs

## Research Significance

### Problem Addressed
- Existing approaches fall short in addressing the accumulative nature of knowledge
- Current methods rely on single time stamp evaluation
- Temporal adaptability of knowledge is often neglected
- Look-ahead bias in chronological knowledge assessment

### Solution
- **ChroKnowBench**: Comprehensive benchmark for temporal knowledge evaluation
- **ChroKnowledge**: Framework for chronological knowledge categorization
- **ChroKnowPrompt**: Non-parametric method for knowledge updates

## Key Findings

### 1. Data Format Dependence
- The ability to elicit temporal knowledge varies depending on the data format the model was trained on
- Different training data formats affect chronological knowledge recall

### 2. Partial Knowledge Recall
- LLMs partially recall knowledge or show cut-offs at temporal boundaries
- Models don't recall all aspects of knowledge correctly across time periods

### 3. Framework Effectiveness
- **Biomedical Domain**: +11.9% improvement in knowledge updates
- **General Domain**: +2.8% improvement in knowledge updates
- **Cross-Model Compatibility**: Works with both open-source and proprietary LLMs

## Technical Approach

### Benchmark Design
- **Multi-Domain Coverage**: Five distinct domains for comprehensive evaluation
- **Time Dependency**: Evaluates knowledge evolution over time
- **Temporal State**: Distinguishes between evolving and constant knowledge
- **Accumulative Nature**: Addresses how knowledge builds and changes over time

### Evaluation Framework
- **Sampling-Based**: Novel approach to chronological knowledge evaluation
- **Non-Parametric**: Updates knowledge without model retraining
- **Temporal Categorization**: Systematic classification of knowledge types
- **Step-by-Step Traversal**: Methodical approach to temporal knowledge elicitation

### Prompting Strategy
- **ChroKnowPrompt**: Specialized prompting for chronological knowledge
- **Time Span Traversal**: Systematic exploration of temporal boundaries
- **Versatility**: Works across different model types and architectures
- **Challenges**: Faces difficulties with dynamic datasets and unstructured formats

## Applications
