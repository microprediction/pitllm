# ChronoBERT / ChronoGPT - Project Summary

## Overview

ChronoBERT and ChronoGPT are chronologically consistent Large Language Models designed for look-ahead-free language understanding and finance return-forecasting. These models are trained with strict temporal boundaries to ensure they only have access to information available up to specific cutoff dates, making them ideal for unbiased historical analysis and time-series forecasting.

## Key Features

### Chronological Consistency
- Models trained only on data available up to specific temporal cutoffs
- No future information leakage during training or inference
- Maintains temporal fidelity for historical analysis

### Dual Model Approach
- **ChronoBERT**: BERT-base models for language understanding tasks
- **ChronoGPT**: GPT-2-medium models for generation and forecasting tasks
- Both models follow the same temporal training methodology

### Coverage Period
- **Time Span**: 1999-2024 (26 years of data)
- **Checkpoints**: Yearly snapshots for consistent temporal analysis
- **Total Models**: 26 yearly BERT-base and GPT-2-medium checkpoints

## Technical Approach

### Model Architecture
- **ChronoBERT**: Based on BERT-base architecture
- **ChronoGPT**: Based on GPT-2-medium architecture
- Temporal boundaries strictly enforced during training

### Training Methodology
- Yearly checkpoints ensure consistent temporal granularity
- Each model trained only on data available up to December 31st of each year
- Prevents any future information from contaminating historical models

### Data Processing
- Temporal filtering to ensure chronological consistency
- Quality control for data integrity across time periods
- Standardized preprocessing for consistent model comparison

## Research Significance

### Problem Addressed
Traditional language models are often trained on temporally indiscriminate corpora, leading to:
- Look-ahead bias in historical analysis
- Inaccurate temporal knowledge representation
- Poor performance in time-sensitive applications

### Solution
ChronoBERT/ChronoGPT provides:
- Temporally faithful language models
- Unbiased historical analysis capabilities
- Reliable time-series forecasting tools

## Applications

### 1. Financial Analysis
- **Return Forecasting**: Predict financial returns using only historical data
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate risk with temporally consistent models
- **Market Analysis**: Analyze market conditions without future bias

### 2. Historical Language Understanding
- **Temporal Language Analysis**: Study language evolution over time
- **Historical Context**: Understand language in its historical context
- **Cultural Evolution**: Track cultural changes through language

### 3. Time-Series Forecasting
- **Predictive Modeling**: Create forecasts without look-ahead bias
- **Backtesting**: Validate strategies with historically accurate models
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify trends using only contemporaneous information

### 4. Research Applications
- **Academic Research**: Support historical and temporal studies
- **Policy Analysis**: Evaluate policies with historical context
- **Social Science**: Study social phenomena over time
