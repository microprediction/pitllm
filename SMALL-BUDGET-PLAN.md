# Point-in-Time LLMs: $500k Realistic Development Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan provides a focused, realistic strategy for advancing point-in-time Large Language Models (PIT-LLMs) with a $500,000 budget. The plan prioritizes leveraging existing open-source work and focuses on specific, achievable deliverables rather than attempting to replicate everything.

## Reality Check: What $500k Actually Buys

### Human Resources (60% of budget = $300,000)
- **2-3 Senior ML Engineers** ($150k-200k/year each) = $300k-600k/year
- **1-2 Data Engineers** ($120k-150k/year each) = $120k-300k/year
- **1 Research Scientist** ($180k-250k/year) = $180k-250k/year
- **1 Project Manager** ($100k-150k/year) = $100k-150k/year

**REALITY**: $500k covers approximately **6-12 months** of a small team (2-3 people), not 2 years of comprehensive development.

### Compute Resources (25% of budget = $125,000)
- **Cloud GPU/TPU training**: $50k-100k for model training
- **Data storage and processing**: $25k-50k
- **Total compute**: Realistically $75k-150k

### Infrastructure & Tools (15% of budget = $75,000)
- **Data acquisition**: $25k-50k
- **Software licenses**: $10k-20k
- **Cloud infrastructure**: $20k-30k

## What We CANNOT Do with $500k

### ❌ Impossible Goals
- Build comprehensive temporal data infrastructure from scratch
- Train large-scale models (GPT-3+ size) from scratch
- Develop multiple domain-specific models
- Create production-ready applications
- Maintain a team for 2+ years
- Compete with major tech companies

### ❌ Overly Ambitious Assumptions
- "Leverage existing work" without significant adaptation costs
- "Extend to larger architectures" without massive compute
- "Create practical applications" without extensive development
- "Scale to larger models" without prohibitive costs

## What We CAN Do with $500k

### ✅ Achievable Goals
- **Extend existing open-source models** with focused improvements
- **Create 1-2 specialized temporal datasets** in specific domains
- **Develop evaluation frameworks** for temporal consistency
- **Build proof-of-concept applications** in 1-2 domains
- **Publish research papers** demonstrating advances
- **Create open-source tools** for the community
